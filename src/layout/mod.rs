//! # Layout
//!
//! This module contains types and utility functions for efficiently calculating layouts.
//!
//! The star of the show here is [`LayoutItem`], a trait that behaves like a closure
//! with some metadata.
//!
//! ## LayoutItem
//!
//! In UI Composer, you draw graphics by producing [`Reifiable`]. Technically speaking,
//! you can do anything with them â€” as you can place your graphics anywhere... But if
//! you write a function that produces primitives yourself, you don't have access to
//! internal variables that might be helpful for laying out (window size, hierarchy, theme, etc.),
//! what we call "parent hints";
//!
//! What you can do though is create a higher order function: a function that returns a closure
//! which in turn produces [`Reifiable`]s, those which can depend on internal data.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![allow(non_snake_case)]
//! # use ui_composer::app::building_blocks::Reifiable;//!
//! # use ui_composer::backends::wgpu::pipeline::text::Text;
//! # use vek::Rgb;
//! # use ui_composer::backends::wgpu::pipeline::UIContext;
//! # use ui_composer::layout::hints::ParentHints;
//!
//! // Like this.
//! // 'text' here is like a "prop" of your component. It's readily available
//! // for you to compose with other components.
//! fn MyText<F, R>(text: String) -> F
//!     where
//!         F: Fn(ParentHints) -> R,
//!         R: Reifiable<UIContext> {
//!
//!     // hints is some internal context that's only gonna be available later.
//!     |hints| {
//!         Text(hints.rect, text, Rgb::white())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let string = String::from("Hello, World");
//!     let app = MyText(string);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This would work but:
//! 1. It looks mad ugly.
//! 2. We can't attach any metadata to the inner closure like minimum size, etc.
//!
//! It makes sense, instead, to return a struct that houses a closure and also some additional
//! information. Instead of a single concrete struct, the library offers [`LayoutItem`] so that
//! different types can be implemented as you see fit.
//!
//! ## Hints
//!
//! There is some rather subtle intercommunication between "parent" and "children" layout items,
//! those happen through [`ParentHints`] and [`ChildHints`], available in [`hints`]. Check that
//! module out for more detail.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! Some utility functions for calculating layouts are in the [`flow`] module.
