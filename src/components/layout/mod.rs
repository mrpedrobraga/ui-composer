//! # Containers
//!
//! Containers are higher-order LayoutItems. You can use components to compose primitive [LayoutItem]s,
//! or to alter how they are layed out on your app.
//!
//! ## Sizing
//!
//! Containers follow a sizing law inspired by Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)... Most layout are equivalent to `struct`.
//!
//! Just how `struct` sizes are calculated based on their fields,
//! Containers minimum sizes are defined by their children's. This eliminates overflow.
//!
//! A container can, however, be _bigger_ than its child. Whenever this happens, the container will stretch the child
//! to fill all available space â€” unless otherwise specified.
//!
//! For example, `Window` makes its layout item fill itself entirely, but [Center] lets the item be small.
