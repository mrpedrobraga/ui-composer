# Things to do

## Reactivity

- Implement reverse-signals: they ability to derive data from many (anonymous) sources.
    - Implement child hints, especially `ChildSizeHints`...
    - Implement more `with_reactive` methods for `WindowNode` to allow children to:
        - Prevent a window from closing.
        - Drag a window.
        - Alter the window's size.

## Layout

- Implement focus.
    - Integrate with access-kit.

## Graphics

- Implement

## Stability

- Add tests. Not sure what I'll be testing, but tests need to be here.
